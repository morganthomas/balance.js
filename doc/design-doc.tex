\maketitle

balance.js is an implementation in progress of a general information presentation solution making solution. It addresses the problem of drawing graphics on the basis of a high-level description of an information presentation. It thus addresses the same basic problem addressed, for example, by Web browser implementations of the HTML, CSS, and DOM standards.

In its present form, balance.js is a JavaScript library which produces graphics in Web pages by sending drawing instructions to an HTML canvas element. The same ideas and code can in theory be adapted to address information presentation problems in other contexts, such as mobile apps, PDF and image generation, and (with more research) 3D/VR user interfaces.

balance.js is an immature system. There is more theoretical progress than there is progress in implementation. There is significant progress in both areas, the result of over two years of R&D Morgan has done. There remains much progress yet to be made. Morgan's primary focus has been on devising the core document layout algorithms. The primary area of issues remaining to be addressed, to achieve a production-ready product, is extending these core layout algorithms to create a developer-friendly API for creating information presentation solutions.
